Module 2 Challenge
Purpose: take raw daily stock information and convert to useable annual summary data providing Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease and Greatest Total Volume for all three years (individual sheets within workbook).
The first part of the code, initializing variables, finding the last row, and first loop, was worked on with study group as well as class examples for census data.
Calculate percent change was also worked on with study group, as well as https://www.mrexcel.com/board/threads/vba-percent-change-function.888523/
The "clean up" code was also class examples as well as Microsoft Learn,

StackOverflow.  I also looked at https://www.kau.edu.sa/Files/0016435/Subjects/Financial%20Modeling%20Using%20Excel%20and%20VBA(1).pdf but it wasn't specifically helpful.
Clean up columns came from:https://excelchamps.com/vba/autofit/
I also worked with my 13yo child, who provided coding examples for formatting. I believe my code is more complicated than it needs to be, but was ultimately unsure how to remedy that and since it works, felt it best to leave it.
